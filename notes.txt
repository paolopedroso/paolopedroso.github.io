To add new updates or changes to your `paolopedroso.github.io` website, follow these steps depending on whether you're updating the source code or redeploying a build.

---

### **If Youâ€™re Adding/Updating Source Code:**
1. **Make Changes Locally**:
   Modify your source code (React components, Tailwind styles, etc.) as needed.

2. **Commit and Push Changes to the Source Code**:
   Push the updated source code to your **main branch** (or the branch youâ€™re using for development):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update source code"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### **If You Want to Deploy the Updated Build:**
After making changes to the source code, you need to **build** the production version and **deploy** it.

1. **Build the Project**:
   Create a production-ready build by running:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the Build to `gh-pages`**:
   Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

This will replace the old build on the `gh-pages` branch with the new build, reflecting your changes on `https://paolopedroso.github.io/`.

---

### **Key Points**
- **Source Code**: Push to the `main` branch.
- **Deployed Site**: Use `npm run build` and `npm run deploy` to update the `gh-pages` branch.

---

### **When to Use Each**
1. **Push to the `main` branch**: When you want to update or save changes to the source code.
2. **Run `npm run deploy`**: When you want to publish the latest changes to your live site.
